## 🚀 About The Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It serves as a central hub to showcase my experience as a Lead Developer, my technical skill set, and my past projects. 

The design follows a **minimalist dark aesthetic** (`#111319` background) with neon cyan and purple accents, focusing on clean typography, smooth animations, and a unique user experience.

### Key Features

* **🛡️ The Gatekeeper:** A unique pre-load overlay that interacts with the visitor before revealing the content (includes a playful check for "idea stealers").
* **✨ Mouse Aura Effect:** A custom JavaScript-driven radial gradient that follows the cursor, adding depth and interactivity to the dark background.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Built with mobile-first CSS Grid and Flexbox to look great on all devices.
* **🖼️ Dynamic Modals:**
    * **Project Details:** extensive views for portfolio items without leaving the page.
    * **Skill Breakdown:** Clickable skill cards that explain *what* I know and *what* I can build with it.
    * **Contact Form:** A clean, modal-based contact interface.
* **💬 Testimonial Slider:** A custom-built vanilla JS slider to display client recommendations.
* **🔒 Security Scripts:** Includes client-side scripts to discourage inspection (disables right-click, F12, Ctrl+U, etc.).

## 🎨 Customization

The code is currently contained within a single file structure for portability, but is organized into clear sections.

* **Colors:** Modify the `:root` variables in the `<style>` section to change the theme.
    ```css
    :root {
        --bg-dark: #111319;
        --accent-cyan: #00F5D4;
        --accent-purple: #9B59B6;
    }
    ```
* **Content:** Edit the HTML sections (`#hero`, `#about`, `#projects`, etc.) to update your personal information.
